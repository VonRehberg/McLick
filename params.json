{"name":"Mclick","tagline":"Mouse Click Highlighter","body":"# mClick - Mouse Click and Cursor Highlighter for screen recordings.\r\n\r\nUse this Chrome extension for the following:\r\n* While doing a screencast recording, this will clearly show where your mouse cursor is and where you click on the page. This can be useful for doing webapp tutorials.\r\n* While doing an online presentation, this can help so that your audience can clearly see where your mouse cursor is.\r\n* If you use Chromecast, this can highlight your mouse cursor to make it easier to spot.\r\n\r\n![Alt text](/example01.gif?raw=true \"Tutorial.\")\r\n![Alt text](/example02.gif?raw=true \"Tutorial.\")\r\n![Alt text](/example03.gif?raw=true \"Tutorial.\")\r\n![Alt text](/example04.gif?raw=true \"Tutorial.\")\r\n![Alt text](/example05.gif?raw=true \"Tutorial.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n* I am NOT a programmer and this is my first Chrome extension. I made extension because I saw a need (for myself) and didn't find anything suitable for what I wanted.\r\n* I realize this extension is not that great and has a lot of room for improvement.\r\n* Below I have a basic roadmap of what I intend (hope) to do with this extension.\r\n* If you have any suggestions or would like to help, you are welcome to send me an email at <mckayc+mclick@gmail.com>.\r\n* To get the most utility from this extension, you should lower your expectations.\r\n\r\n# Road map:\r\n\r\n**✓ Version 0.2** - Have a basic functional extension.\r\n* Mouse cursor is highlighted when moving on the screen.\r\n* There are mouse click indications for mouse down and mouse up.\r\n* You can turn the extension on and off.\r\n\r\n**✓ Version 0.3** - Have user input for most basic functions.\r\n* User can input custom values for highlight size for all functions (move, click, mouseup, etc).\r\n* User can input custom values for colors.\r\n* User can input custom values for opacities.\r\n\r\n**✓ Version 0.4** - Polished extension. - Still needs more work\r\n* Icons will be improved and looked better.\r\n* Options window will actually look nice(r) and only be as big as needed. ~~Popup window instead of full window. (I don't think this is actually possible.)~~\r\n* Default settings for extension will make it look nice and negate any need for most people to ever use options.\r\n\r\n**Version 0.5** - First release.\r\n* Do thorough testing and bug fixes. Make sure basic functions work as intended in most circumstances.\r\n* Package extension and put it on the Chrome app store.\r\n* Add example gif in this README.md\r\n\r\n**Version 0.6** - Extended features.\r\n* Improve transitions and animations (give user options for these?).\r\n* Come up with something nifty for click and drag. Perhaps a new div shape?\r\n* In options, have live preview for shapes.\r\n\r\n**Version 0.7** - Improve options. ~~No need for manual input.~~\r\n* Start implementing some of Dallin's code such as right click, left click, middle click and double click.\r\n* ~~User has the option to use color picker for colors.~~\r\n* User has the option to use a slider for object size.\r\n* ~~User has the option to use a slider for opacity.~~\r\n\r\n**Version 0.8** - Explore more features. Test features to see if they are useful or not.\r\n* Have an indicator for scroll up and scroll down. (?)\r\n* Improve animations.\r\n* Have user options to toggle every feature.\r\n\r\n**Version 0.9** - Bug fixes, code cleanup, and final polish.\r\n* Fix all bugs so that the extension works in all likely environments.\r\n* Look over code and clean up what is not necessary. Improve comments to make extension more useful to someone who wants to fork code.\r\n* Make any last changes for version 1 release.\r\n\r\n**Version 1.0** - Release!\r\n* Rerelease on Chrome app store.\r\n* Share extension with coworkers and friends.\r\n* Write blog post about extension and do some promotion.\r\n* Update roadmap for version 2.0.\r\n* Buy myself ice cream and/or pizza and celebrate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Version 2.0+** - Start integrating keyboard indicators.\r\n* Come up with a slick way to show keyboard key presses.\r\n* Find out how to display key press combinations.\r\n* Allow user options to toggle this feature.\r\n* Be able to use on more than just the active page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Credits:**\r\n* For the basic framework of this extension, I looked at the Chrome extension \"mouse_thing\" (https://github.com/jared-schmidt/mouse_thing).\r\n* For the color picker, I used Spectrum (https://bgrins.github.io/spectrum).\r\n* For the value sliders, I intend to use Simple Slider (http://loopj.com/jquery-simple-slider/) though I have not figured out how to implement this yet.\r\n* For bug fixes and additional code, I enlisted the help of my friends Matt and Ryan as well as my brother Dallin.\r\n","google":"UA-41005067-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
