# McLick - Mouse Cursor and Click Highlighter for screencast recordings.

This is an offline Google Chrome extention. Use this extension for the following:
* While doing a screencast recording, this will clearly show where your mouse cursor is and where you click on the page.
* While doing a presentation, this can help so that your audience can clearly see where your mouse cursor is.
* If you use a Chromecast, this can highlight your mouse cursor to make it easier to spot.

Note: This exension is a collaboration of code from the existing Chrome extension "mouse_thing" (https://github.com/jared-schmidt/mouse_thing), my friend Ryan's code, and my brother Dallins code. I am not a programmer and have no idea what I am doing. You should lower your expectations before using this extension.

#Road map:

Version 0.2 - Have a basic functional extension.
*Mouse cursor is highlighted when moving on the screen.
*There are mouse click indications for mouse down and mouse up.
*You can turn the extension on and off.
