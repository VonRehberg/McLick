Mouse Click Highlighter - Chrome app for highlighting mouse clicks; for use when you are doing a screencast.

This app/repository is for the purpose of teaching myself how to program. You should expect nothing useful here. If you want to help with my app, you are more than welcome! (Warning: I have no idea what I am doing.)

Nope. THat didn't work. I am going to try git gui.
